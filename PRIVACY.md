YouTube Time URL Sync does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data or browsing history. All logic runs locally in the page:
- The script reads the current playback position of the YouTube video you are watching and updates the `t` query parameter in the URL via `history.replaceState`.
- No data leaves the browser, and no information is sent to any server.
- The extension does not use analytics, remote logging, or third-party services.
